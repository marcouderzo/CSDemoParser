## The Parser: demoinfogo

### Why we chose it

[demoinfogo](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-demoinfo) is the official CS:GO opensource parser developed by Valve Software written in C/C++.

### Building demoinfogo onÂ Windows

In order to build demoinfogo on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Download [protobuf-2.5.0.zip](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protobuf-2.5.0.zip) and extract it into the `parser` folder. This creates the folder `parser/protobuf-2.5.0`.
2. Download the Protobuf compiler [protoc-2.5.0.zip](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protoc-2.5.0-win32.zip) and extract it into the `parser/protoc-2.5.0-win32` folder.
3. Open `parser/protobuf-2.5.0/vsprojects/protobuf.sln` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Allow Visual Studio to convert the projects.
4. Build the *Release* configuration of `libprotobuf`. Building any other projects is not required.
5. Open `parser/demoinfogo.vcxproj` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Building the Release configuration creates the binary `parser/demoinfogo.exe`

## Automating the Parsing of the Match Pool

### autoparse.py

As the match pool is very large, parsing every match manually is just not feasable.
So, given the folder where all `.dem` matches are saved, the script will call a shell command for each match, telling demoinfogo to parse it. The `.txt` log file will be saved in `parser/logs` folder.
If any of the subprocesses return an exit code different than `1`, which is the default exit code of demoinfogo, then that means the parsing was not successful, and after finishing to parse all the match pool, you will find the failed match name listed in the report.
To setup the script, make sure you edit `demospath` in the source code to match your own demo folder. Then run the script with `python3 autoparse.py`.
