## Downloading the Matches

### Finding Matches
In order to populate the match pool, we need 50 players and 100 matches for each of them. Using Steam APIs is not possible. 
Although since 9/17/2019, Valve provided an API that allows players to give access to third-party websites to download their matchs history, not every user can get those informations. Indeed, the [documentation](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Access_Match_History) states that to do that you would need a Game Authentication Code created by the user, together with one of their match sharing codes. So, unless you make them log-in through the Steam API and ask them to partecipate to the project, this path doesn't lead anywhere.
So we had to look on third-party websites that already use this method. [csgostats.gg](https://csgostats.gg) is a website where you can find all the matches played, check for specific players (Pros and generic players also), and watch their demos. As you clicked the Watch Demo link, it would launch the Steam Bootstrapper and would start up CS:GO and download the match locally. Unfortunately, csgostats have CAPTCHAS that just make the automation of the procedure very tricky, maybe not even possible.

### Where are matches saved and How are they shared?
Demos are saved on Valve's servers and are downloadable from a link in the form of http://replay131.valve.net/730/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxx.dem.bz2, where "x" is the MatchID, OutcomeID and TokenID.
[node-csgo](https://github.com/joshuaferrara/node-csgo) is a really powerful plugin for CS:GO, also used by csgostats.gg to get the matches.
What we needed to do was not in the cards for node-csgo, but it is still worth mentioning why. It is possible to retrieve the link in two ways:
- using `requestRecentGames()` : Requests a list of recent games for the currently logged in account. Listen for the `matchList` event for the game coordinator's response, where you will find the link as:  `"map": "http://replay124.valve.net/730/003072985384448163905_0699089210.dem.bz2"`. Still, that cannot be done as you would need to make the player log-in.
- using `CSGO.SharecodeDecoder(string code).decode();` That should return the MatchID, OutcomeID and TokenID needed to reconstruct the link.
Unfortunately, CS:GO sharecodes are not public and cannot be retrieved in any way unless the player itself gives it to you or allows the third party website to retrieve it through the Steam API.

### Our Choice: hltv.org

[hltv](https://hltv.org) is an extremely popular website used to track Pro CS:GO Competitive Matches.
This third-party website allows us to track down a specific player and retrieve all his previous matches. It is noteworthy that hltv.org downloads the match directly exactly like any other download without using any Steam Protocol or API whatsoever, so it looks like it is a much easier alternative, if it is also possible to download matches outside the Pro-League or the competitive league.

## The Parser: demoinfogo

### Why we chose it

[demoinfogo](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-demoinfo) is the official CS:GO opensource parser developed by Valve Software written in C/C++.

### Building demoinfogo onÂ Windows

In order to build demoinfogo on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Download [protobuf-2.5.0.zip](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protobuf-2.5.0.zip) and extract it into the `parser` folder. This creates the folder `parser/protobuf-2.5.0`.
2. Download the Protobuf compiler [protoc-2.5.0.zip](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protoc-2.5.0-win32.zip) and extract it into the `parser/protoc-2.5.0-win32` folder.
3. Open `parser/protobuf-2.5.0/vsprojects/protobuf.sln` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Allow Visual Studio to convert the projects.
4. Build the *Release* configuration of `libprotobuf`. Building any other projects is not required.
5. Open `parser/demoinfogo.vcxproj` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Building the Release configuration creates the binary `parser/demoinfogo.exe`

## Automating the Parsing of the Match Pool

### autoparse.py

As the match pool is very large, parsing every match manually is just not feasable.
So, given the folder where all `.dem` matches are saved, the script will call a shell command for each match, telling demoinfogo to parse it. The `.txt` log file will be saved in `parser/logs` folder.
If any of the subprocesses return an exit code different than `1`, which is the default exit code of demoinfogo, then that means the parsing was not successful, and after finishing to parse all the match pool, you will find the failed match name listed in the report.
To setup the script, make sure you edit `demospath` in the source code to match your own demo folder. Then run the script with `python3 autoparse.py`.
