## What is this project about?
The goal is to automate the retrievement and parsing of a large pool of CS:GO matches, logging every event and action of a specific player, such as camera movements, player steps and actions performed.

The dataset will be used by the [UniPD SPRITZ Cybersecurity Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/) for research purposes in the fields of cybersecurity and privacy, i.e. determining if an AI can recognize a player based on how he interacts with the videogame.
