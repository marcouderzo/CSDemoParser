## What is this project about?
The goal is to parse CS:GO matches, logging every event and action of a specific player, such as camera movements, player steps and actions performed. The data extracted will be used by the [UniPD SPRITZ Cybersecurity Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/) for research purposes, such as determining if an AI can automatically recognize a player based on how he interacts with the game.
